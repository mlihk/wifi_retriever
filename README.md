This project is for those who always forgets their wifi password, either because the password is too long and complicated.
Now you can use this script to get the password of the current network you are connected to, display it then send that information to an email address.

!!! Please beware that the the {replace} in the sourcecode is for you to replace with the relative information. !!!

Since I am using gmail's smtp, the password will not be the password you use to login. As their protective measurement.
You shall generate an APP password from google under your account, and paste that APP password (16 digits) to the password " "
and it should work.

Feel free to modify it for further purpose!

Also saves the password into a local txt document.
